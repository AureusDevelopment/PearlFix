# Pearl Fix

The purpose of this plugin is to fix an as-of-yet unfixed mistake in vanilla minecraft that allows for enderpearls thrown past the world border to teleport players to their death.

There is no configuration of this plugin. Just drag and drop it into your server, restart, and any pearls that land beyond the world border will cancel the player teleport event.
